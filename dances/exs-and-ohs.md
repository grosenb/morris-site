## History
Created late at night while not-entirely-sober at Windham's 2019 retreat in Montague, MA.  Inspired by the reference to X's and O's, which are figures we are used to making in the dance Charrington Toby.  Choreography process included the suggestion "2 Scissor Capers!" from Arthur Davis who had appeared to be sleeping but even in such a state could solve choreography dilemmas.
